TLDR: It's a sidebar-friendly 𓃑 launcher for Google Apps, basically.  Just add the demo URL as a custom side panel in Vivaldi (or elsewhere): https://sites.google.com/view/gwaf or make your own.<br>   <br>
Longform Description: This is an embeddable Google Waffle Dropdown Menu/App Launcher implementation for Vivaldi custom sidebar web panels, and other browsers with similar features.  I made this for my own use but I thought I would share it here in case anyone else finds it useful.<br><br>I thought it would be nice if the Google App "Waffle Menu" thing (looks like 𓃑) was an option in the sidebar so I wouldn't have a ton of different google services cluttering up my bookmarks toolbar.<img width=500px lt="${f}" src="https://github.com/ShortCats/GoogleWaffle/blob/0f5cc522cc999d365abd7675adcc2540a88fee8b/2025-11-07%2021.55.12%20forum.vivaldi.net%201584aa6515a6.png" /><br>

Ten hours in Dreamweaver later (with some help from ChatGPT) I had Google Waffle, a customized embeddable version of the Google launchpad for Google services designed for use as a Vivaldi sidebar Web Panel. <br><br>I messed around with the order of apps a bit like adding Google Voice/Scholar and some other stuff that wasn't there in Google's version, but all you have to do to use it as-is is to add the URL https://sites.google.com/view/gwaf as a custom web panel and it should be good to go.  Alternatively, if you want to mess around with the source code or move stuff around, see GoogleWaffle.html(see screenshots below).

Additional Notes: I've only tested it on Vivaldi for macOS (and iOS) but it don't see any reason it wouldn't work also on Linux or Windows versions of vivaldi (or any other browser that supports custom Web Panels, although I can't think of any that do).  Also it works fine as a regular webpage but the search suggestions feature in the source code doesn't work on Google Sites, but does in Dreamweaver sandbox so the code is fine, that feature is just disabled on embedded html on GSites. 

Gemini hasn't been super helpful with the coding in my experience, but did do a bang up job whipping up the favicon and a logo for it, so credit where due. <br>

Also, props to ChatGPT for knocking it out of the park with the CSS on this one.  I usually use DeepSeek but was honestly very impressed with GPT this time.  <br><br>Originally posted at https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/113192/custom-made-web-panel-google-waffle-app-launcher-sidebar-menu
